								<p> Hi, my name is Dylan! I'm currently sophomore at UC Berkeley studying computer science, and
								 	I'm particularly interested in machine learning, blockchain, and general full-stack development.
									Outside of school, I enjoy playing piano, speedsolving Rubik's cubes, and spending time outdoors!
									Please feel free to contact me below. I'd love to chat!</p>

								<h3> Indelve </h3>
								<h6> <a href="https://github.com/dtran16/curatedacademicjournal" target="_blank"> Github </a>| <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FT-BDOkGKhvB6lAIjWjLSjQXtooB-lfG_t6dq5lfJ74/edit#slide=id.g59cad322ae_0_241" target="_blank">Pitch Deck </a> </h6>
								<h6> <a href="#indelve"> Pictures </a> </h6>
								<p>This semester, as a part of Blockchain at Berkeley,
								    I worked on an internal project team to develop Indelve, a blockhain-based research paper publishing application.
									It uses smart contracts to enable the entire process from uploading a paper to getting a paper read, rated, and voted on to having it published.
								 	What makes the system more unique than traditional publishing systems and research paper archives is that not only does the nature of
									blockchain allow for it to be a completely transparent process but also it allows for the public to partake in the publishing procedure as
									preliminary screeners to identify papers, through staking tokens of our internal cryptocurrency, that are of the highest quality to be reviewed first.
									The application is built with Solidity, React, and Web3.js. Please feel free to check it out in more details at the slide deck and repository linked above!</p>

								<h3> Pothole Detection (LA Hacks 2019)</h3>
								<h6> <a href="https://github.com/eprotagoras/iOSDH" target="_blank"> Github </a>| <a href="https://devpost.com/software/deephole">Devpost </a></h6>
								<h6> <a href="#pothole"> Pictures </a> </h6>
								<p>Potholes are a prevalent infrastructure problem, causing damage and accidents for drivers worldwide. Currently, there is no streamlined process to report potholes, a depression in the road caused by erosion, other than calling a number. However, it is unlikely that the average driver is going to immediately call this number while driving, remember the location, or report it afterwards. My team and I created an iOS app that functions as a dash cam and automates the process of reporting potholes. The app frequently sends image to a trained deep learning model on Google Cloud Platform. If it determines that the image contains a pothole, it sends the image and location to a Firebase database. An application developed using React and Javascript then visualizes the frequency of reported potholes on a heat map using Google Maps API and lists report details on a sidebar, information that can be used by infrastructure planners to analyze where potholes are causing the most problems.</p>

								<h3> Up 2 Date (Tree Hacks 2019) </h3>
								<h6> <a href="https://github.com/jamqd/Up2Date" target="_blank">Github </a>| <a href="https://devpost.com/software/up2date#updates">Devpost </a></h6>
								<h6> <a href="#up2date"> Pictures </a> </h6>
								<p> Current mainstream news outlet subscriptions generally only allow you to subscribe to perhaps one topic such as climate change or technology or only one news source. You wouldn't be able to
								subscribe to such a specific topic such as how technology is affecting climate change. My team and I developed a chrome extension that allows multi-source news subscription to user-generated topics.
								While reading a news article, a user may find a specific phrase or topic interesting such as "using technology to fight climate change". They can then choose to open the chrome extension, highlight this phrase, and subscribe to "using technology to fight climate change".
								Using a threshold algorithm by analyzing features such as news frequency, popularity, and volume published, if the topic is currently trending or there is relevant breaking news, the user is emailed an update as well as relevant news articles using the Microsoft Bing Search API. This was built using
								HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, AWS, and Firebase. Built at Tree Hacks hacking under the awareness vertical.</p>

								<h3> Bac Trac (Cal Hacks 2018) </h3>

								<p>Currently, it is difficult to keep track of someone's exact blood alcohol content. People can only guess how much the alcohol is current affecting them. To address this
								 	and to promote safety, my team and I created an iOS app that uses personalized features including height, weight, and age to calculate a person's blood alcohol content based on how
									much they have had to drink. The user simply clicks a button every time a unit of drink is ingested and the app will update them on their blood alcohol content and how much longer
									they have left until they are completely sober. Additionally, the app features a system where friends can form groups before spending a night out so that they can monitor each other's levels
									and ensure that everyone is safe. This was built using Swift and Firebase.</p>

								<h3> Candidate Tracker </h3>
								<h6> <a href="#tracker"> Pictures </a> </h6>
								<p>As a part of the web development team on Upsilon Pi Epsilon, UC Berkeley's CS Honor Society, I worked on improving the record keeping system. The current system features a single spreadsheet which is cumbersome to update and to check progress. Therefore, we built an application that includes features to add events,
									check into events which updates the current records, and for candidates to check their progress in completing the requirements. This streamlines the process for over 100 organization members. Built with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase.</p>

								<h3> Alexa Skills </h3>
								<h6> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=dtran16&i=alexa-skills&ref=nb_sb_noss" target="_blank"> Store </a></h6>
								<h6> <a href="#alexa"> Pictures </a> </h6>
								<p>In my senior year of high school, I built 2 Amazon Alexa Skills, "Christmas Songs" and "Father's Day Compliments" and published them both to the Amazon Alexa skills store. The first enables Alexa to suggest Christmas songs for users to play at home or at holiday events. This skill received over 2000 users.
									The second skill enables Alexa to give compliments to fathers which was built around the time of Father's Day. After building these skills, I received a free Amazon Alexa Developer backpack and hoodie as well as a free echo! Feel free to check out my skills and enable them on your own Alexa at the link above!</p>
